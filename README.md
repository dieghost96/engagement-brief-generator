## How the Claude API is wired

The app calls the Anthropic API directly from the browser. The API key is **not required in the code** — it is handled by the Claude.ai artifact environment.

> ⚠️ **Important:** If you plan to deploy this outside of Claude.ai (e.g. on Vercel or Netlify), you will need to move the API call to a backend/serverless function and inject your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` securely via environment variables. Never expose your API key in frontend code.

## Future improvements

- [ ] Connect to CRM (HubSpot / Notion)
